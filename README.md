### What's this?
See <a href="https://github.com/hokumski/GettingAndCleaningData_CourseProject/blob/master/CodeBook.md">CodeBook</a> 
for the explanation what the data is.

### Data manipulation in run_analysis.R
You have downloaded dataset from <a href="http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones#">this (original)</a>
or <a href="https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip">this (mirror)</a> server, then unzipped all the data to your R 
directory; so files 'subject_test.txt', 'subject_train.txt', 'X_test.txt', 'Y_test.txt', 'X_train.txt', 
'y_train.txt', 'activity_labels.txt', 'features.txt' are in your working directory.

Type getwd() to ensure you are in your directory and list.files() to check it contains these files.
